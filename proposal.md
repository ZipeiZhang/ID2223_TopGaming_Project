### Proposal for Machine Learning System Development

#### Problem Description

**Data Sources:** The “Traffic Accidents Reports,” from the San Francisco government’s Open Data Platform, will serve as the main data source for this machine learning system. This dataset is very detailed and includes information about traffic accidents such as the time they occurred, the severity of the incidents, location point, etc.

**Prediction Problem:** The ML system will be centered on forecasting the severity of traffic accidents in San Francisco. The goal is to categorize each event in terms of severity, ranging from ‘Minor’ up to ‘Fatal’ levels based on past records. This prediction will help to optimize emergency response and urban planning.

#### Tools

For this project, we will explore a combination of traditional and advanced machine-learning tools:

- **Decision Trees:** The decision trees will be one of the primary tools used throughout and thus, serve as baseline models to compare with.
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow:** These modern advanced deep learning frameworks will be used to build and develop more intricate models such as neural networks.
- **New Tools and Technologies:** We are ready to consider the use of other machine learning tools and technologies, like gradient boosting frameworks (XGBoost is an example) or automated ML platforms (like AutoML).

#### Data

**Data Utilization:** We will be using the traffic accident reports dataset, already mentioned above with over 800,000 entries. This database contains information about more than a million incidents happening on San Francisco streets.

**Data Collection:** The dataset can be accessed using an App Token and the sodapy package. We will retrieve the total historical data (limit set to 800,000).

#### Methodology and Algorithm

**Data Preprocessing:**

- Subset Selection: Filtering relevant columns for the analysis.
- Severity Mapping: Identifying incidents to categorize into different severity classes.
- Weather and Road Conditions Grouping: Amalgamating variety of conditions into broadened groups.
- Categorical Mapping: Converting categorical variables into a numerical scale.

**Feature Engineering:**

- Employing advanced data analysis techniques using seaborn and matplotlib for detailed data visualization and insights.
- Implementing sophisticated feature engineering steps including one-hot encoding, standardization, and handling missing values.

**Proposed Algorithms:**

- **MLPClassifier (from the previous project):** In the comparative analysis, we will include MLPClassifier as it has shown high performance and stability.
- **Decision Trees:** To establish a baseline and for interpretability.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Utilizing PyTorch/TensorFlow when developing advanced neural network architectures.
- **Exploration of Additional Models:** If initial results show promise, we may also explore other algorithms such as XGBoost or even experiment with AutoML solutions.

#### Conclusion

This ML system seeks to offer a high-tech tool for predicting the severity of traffic accidents in San Francisco. The main goal of this project is to make a significant contribution to enhancing emergency response strategies and urban planning efforts. This will be achieved by performing proper data preprocessing, feature engineering, and considering a wide range of machine learning models. The system’s ability to incorporate new tools and technologies ensures flexibility and adaptability as technology continues to evolve.
